# FWER - new panels - table 2
# one family per outcome (running/voteshare)
# all subsamples within the same family.


# we will obtain two families (two tables with different types of outcomes)
# again, runs or voteshare.
# but here, more hesitation: because gender reservation not evaluated in the og table

# one version would be: six tables in total.
# for each type of outcome, three subsamples 

# another would be two tables in total.
# one outcome is a family, and we evaluate all subsamples.
